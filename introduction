## **2️⃣ Neural Networks (NNs)**

* Composed of **neurons (nodes)** arranged in **layers**:

  * Input → Hidden Layers → Output
* Each neuron performs:
  [
  y = f(Wx + b)
  ]
  where `f` is a **non-linear activation function**.
* **Activation Functions:**

  * **ReLU** → used in deep nets to avoid vanishing gradients
  * **Sigmoid / Tanh** → used in binary outputs or older RNNs

---

## **3️⃣ Why Non-Linearity?**

* Linear models can only learn straight-line relationships.
* Real-world data is complex → need **non-linear transformations** (ReLU, Sigmoid).
* Enables deep networks to learn *complex patterns* like images, language, and sound.

---

## **4️⃣ Deep Learning Training Process**

* **Forward Propagation:** Input flows through layers → output predicted.
* **Backward Propagation:** Error (loss) is sent backward → weights updated.
* Uses **Gradient Descent** to minimize loss.

---

## **5️⃣ Vanishing Gradient Problem**

* In deep networks or RNNs, gradients become very small as they flow backward.
* Early layers stop learning → model stagnates.
* Solved using ReLU, Batch Normalization, and architectures like LSTM or ResNet.

---

## **6️⃣ CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**

* Specialized for **images**.
* Uses **convolutional filters** to detect patterns (edges, textures, shapes).
* Key layers: Convolution → Pooling → Fully Connected → Output.
* Example: Image classification, object detection.

---

## **7️⃣ RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)**

* Designed for **sequential data** (text, speech, time series).
* Maintains “memory” of previous inputs using a **hidden state**.
* Formula:
  [
  h_t = f(Wx_t + Uh_{t-1} + b)
  ]
* Limitations:

  * Can’t remember long-term dependencies (due to vanishing gradients).

---

## **8️⃣ LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**

* Improved version of RNN.
* Introduces **gates** to control information flow:

  * **Forget Gate:** decides what to forget.
  * **Input Gate:** decides what new info to add.
  * **Output Gate:** decides what to output.
* Helps retain long-term memory (used in text, speech tasks before Transformers).

---

## **9️⃣ Sequence Modeling**

* Goal: predict or generate data sequences (e.g., next word, stock price, sound wave).
* RNNs/LSTMs handle this but can’t parallelize easily.
* Led to the invention of **Transformers**, which model sequences without recurrence.

---

## **🔟 Attention Mechanism**

> “Don’t look at everything, focus on what matters.”

* Instead of processing one step at a time (like RNN), Attention lets the model look at **all words at once** and weigh their importance.
* Example:

  * In “The cat sat on the mat,” the word “cat” relates more to “sat” than “mat.”
* Improves long-term context understanding.

---

## **1️⃣1️⃣ Transformers (2017 – Present)**

* Introduced in paper *“Attention is All You Need”*.
* Replaced RNN/LSTM with **self-attention** mechanism.
* Fully parallelizable → much faster training.
* Core parts:

  1. **Embedding Layer:** Converts words → numerical vectors.
  2. **Positional Encoding:** Adds position info since Transformer doesn’t process sequentially.
  3. **Self-Attention:** Computes relationships between all words in a sentence.
  4. **Feed-Forward Layers:** Apply nonlinear transformations.
  5. **Residual Connections + Layer Norm:** Helps stable training.

---

## **1️⃣2️⃣ Embeddings**

* Words or tokens are represented as **dense vectors** (e.g., 300 dimensions).
* Words with similar meanings have **similar embeddings**.
* Example: vector(“king”) - vector(“man”) + vector(“woman”) ≈ vector(“queen”)
* Created using models like Word2Vec, GloVe, or learned directly in Transformers.

## **1️⃣3️⃣ Generative AI (GenAI)**

Two major categories:

| Type                           | Example Models          | Generates            |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Generative Language Models** | GPT, Claude, Gemini     | Text, code, dialogue |
| **Generative Image Models**    | GANs, Diffusion, DALL·E | Images, art, design  |

---

## **1️⃣4️⃣ GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)**

* Has **Generator** (creates fake images) and **Discriminator** (detects fakes).
* Trained in a *competition* until generator produces realistic outputs.
* Used for:

  * Face generation (ThisPersonDoesNotExist)
  * Image synthesis & editing
  * Data augmentation

---

## **1️⃣5️⃣ Diffusion Models**

* Modern image generators (e.g., **Stable Diffusion**, **DALL·E 3**).
* Work by:

  1. Adding random noise to an image.
  2. Learning how to remove noise step by step.
* No separate generator/discriminator — it’s a *probabilistic denoising process*.

---

## **1️⃣6️⃣ Large Language Models (LLMs)**

* Advanced **Transformer-based** deep learning models.
* Trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate language.

**Training Stages:**

1. **Pretraining (Self-Supervised):** Predict next word — learns language patterns.
2. **Supervised Fine-Tuning:** Learns to follow human instructions.
3. **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback):** Optimizes behavior based on human preferences.

**Capabilities:**

* Text generation, summarization, translation, code writing, reasoning.
